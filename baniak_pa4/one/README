This is a program that takes in an array of of arguments, determines
if each string is a number or a character string.

Numbers are added to another. Strings check if they are a substring
of any char string in the rest of the array.

The makefile:
	cc - chooses the compiler
	cflags - environment variable
	src - obtains header files for the source
	obj - links to object file

deater is the name of the executable

main.o and func.o are object files

clean - removes any files ending in .o and the deater file

*** printing substrings before the total of the integers 
*** was approved by yousefi
